          <h1>Recreation</h1>
          <p>I enjoy taking part in clubs and various public activities on campus. I am a representative in residence hall student government and a member of Emerging Eagles, a leadership program on campus that seeks to help students learn team-building skills. I am also a part of a creative self-exploration group which seeks to help students better understand themselves. In my free time when I am not participating in campus clubs or activities, I enjoy playing with my dogs, taking care of my guinea pig, and relaxing with my friends. Below is some audio and video of my favorite animal, the whale!</p>
